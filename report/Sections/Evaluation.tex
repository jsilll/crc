\label{Evaluation}

In order to evaluate the performance of both alorithms, we decided to implemented them in C++ using the Boost Graph Library's (BGL) \footnote{\url{https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html}} graph data structure. This allowed us to easily generate random graph instances and to use the BGL's built-in functions to visualize the graphs and the k-cores. Moreover, having the both algorithms implemented in the same language and using the same graph data structure allowed us to compare them in a fair way.
