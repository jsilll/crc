\label{Conclusion}

The K-Cores Problem represents a powerful paradigm in graph theory and network analysis, offering nuanced insights into the intricate world of interconnected systems. By delving into cohesive substructures within networks, this concept has far-reaching implications across various domains.

In order to identify the K-Cores in a graph, we evaluated two algorithms on a set of benchmarks, the Degree Pruning algorithm and a Depth-First Search approach to the K-Cores problem. Due to, primarily, the queue's size and the duplication of nodes, the Degree Pruning Algorithm is way less efficient than its Depth-First Search counter part. However, these conclusions are limited by the set of benchmarks used.

Although there is more research to be made in this area, as mentioned in section \ref{FutureWork}, this study contributed to identifying the most efficient algorithms for solving the K-Cores problem. As networks continue to evolve and expand in complexity, the K-Cores Problem remains a cornerstone in understanding their underlying structures with applications in diverse fields, making it an indispensable asset in the toolkit of network analysts and researchers worldwide.
