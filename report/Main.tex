\begin{abstract}
    In the fields of network analysis and graph theory, the K-Cores Problem is a potent paradigm that provides important insights into the complex webs of interrelated systems. Its ramifications cut across many fields, enabling analysts and researchers to solve the puzzles of intricate networks.
    
    The discovery of K-Cores in the context of social networks illuminates close-knit communities, improving our understanding of interpersonal relationships and social dynamics. It helps identify important components in biological networks, which leads to improvements in the study of diseases and the development of new drugs. K-Cores identify important websites and content hubs and reveal the core of the digital world when applied to the internet and web graphs. Furthermore, K-Cores identify crucial links in infrastructure and transportation networks, strengthening urban planning tactics and streamlining traffic.

    We compared two methods for K-Core identification in graphs: a Degree Pruning technique and a Depth-First Search strategy customised for the K-Cores problem. Due to considerations like queue size and node duplication, the results clearly favour the Depth-First Search strategy, making it far more efficient than the Degree Pruning Algorithm.

    As mentioned in section \ref{FutureWork}, further research in this area is necessary, but this work advances the continuing effort to find the best methods for resolving the K-Cores problem. The K-Cores Problem continues to be a key to comprehending the underlying architecture of networks as they develop and become more complicated. Its numerous uses in various industries highlight its importance and make it an essential tool for network analysts and researchers everywhere.
